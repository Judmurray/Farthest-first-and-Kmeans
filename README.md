# Farthest-first-and-Kmeans
This is a project I completed outlining implementations to the farthest-first centroid clustering algorithm as well as a parallel implementation of the K-means algorithm using OpenMP in C. 

Previously, I had written a file, FarFirst.c, in order to use the farthest-first clustering in my implementation, and I utilized it here in setting up an OpenMP K-means algorithm. Additionally, there is timing and performance testing accompanying as well as a brief performance write-up at the end.
